1.Compare C# and Java
Thera are both languadges for aplications and software.C# is a object-oriented languadge. C# is a part of .Net Framework and his purpose is to make much easyer programers life when they are developig Windows Aplications and Softaware. Java is language with open sorce code witch means it can be develop and update from Java society. C# is develop and updating only from Microsoft. For example IBM, Oracle and SAP are using Java for their aplications.
2.Compare C# and Phyton.
Python is strongly typed.Python variables are not strongly typed. Indeed, Python variables are just labels on objects. Variables are not declared. C# is statically typed. The variables are declared to the compiler to be of a specific type. The code is generated based on certain knowledge about the variables use at run-time.Python is "interpreted" things are done at run-time. C# is compiled the compiler generates code based on the declared assumptions.
3.Compare C# and Delphi.
C# is based on "C" languadge family, Delphi is based on Phascal witch one is easy to understand and lurn. C# and Delphi have a generic type and method language feature. Although these two languages are statically typed, they implement generics in very different ways. In C# and Delphi, there is a language feature which is solely dedicated to implementing generic types and methods.
4.Compare C# and C++.
C# is a simple, modern, object oriented, and type-safe programming language derived from C and C++. C# is firmly planted in the C and C++ family tree of languages,and will immediately be familiar to C and C++ programmers. C# aims to combine the high productivity of Visual Basic and the raw power of C++. C++ code usually compiles to assembly language. C# by contrast compiles to Intermediate language (IL), which has some similarities to java byte code.
5.Compare C# and PHP.
PHP generates directly the HTML / JS / CSS used to compose the page and produce the end HTML page directly from the code or if you are smart enough using things like templates engines. You must know HTML at least to be able to develop PHP web sites. When you give away a soft written in PHP you normally give out your sources as nothing is compiled. To avoid that you must use some special software to encrypt your code, and those soft are not free nor really safe.
